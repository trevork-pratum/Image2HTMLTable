# Image2HTMLTable
 Generates an HTML table from an image. Uses table background color (RGB). Some weirdness may occur and the output may not be pretty for medium or large images.

# Goals
Generate images using pure HTML/CSS (in file only). No JS or other external libraries should be included. Using newer CSS3 features like webkit is fine, but the user should have the option to not use it. Support for CSS2 (or older) should be the priority.

# Dependencies
- Python 3.9+
- PIL
- Numpy

# TODO
- Add Python front-end/CLI interface to make it easier to use.
- Add CSS3 option for transparent images
